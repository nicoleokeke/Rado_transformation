# Radon_transformation

The radon transform is like the sum along an angle, just like as if you had done an x-ray along that angle. For a 2D image, it gives you a 1-D profile. It's not a bad analogy - the radon transform is the x-ray of the image along an angle. In fact, radon transforms are used in CT and MRI reconstruction.

The max value of the profile will be the "ray" that passed through the densest (i.e. brightest) part of the image.
